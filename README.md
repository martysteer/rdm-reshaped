# RDM Reshaped

This repository combines research data management (RDM) concepts with interactive storytelling tools to create a novel approach for organizing and communicating research information.

## Project Overview

This project explores the intersection of research data management principles and interactive narrative structures, particularly using the Twine storytelling platform. By leveraging Twine's storylet system and other narrative design patterns, we aim to create a more engaging and flexible way to present complex research data management concepts.

## Repository Contents

### Research Data Management Materials

- **Main Topics in Research Data Management**: Core concepts including data management planning, collection, storage, metadata, preservation, sharing, ethics, and infrastructure.
- **Additional RDM Topics**: Extended concepts including data quality assurance, visualization, cost management, training, interoperability, citation, and lifecycle management.
- **Reprojection Rubric Reference Frame (RRRF)**: A matrix framework for examining RDM from multiple perspectives across the research ecosystem.

## Project Goals

1. Create a flexible framework for organizing research data management information
2. Leverage interactive storytelling techniques to make RDM concepts more accessible
3. Develop reusable patterns for presenting complex information in engaging ways
4. Explore how narrative design principles can enhance research communication
